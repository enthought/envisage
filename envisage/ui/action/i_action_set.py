    # A mapping from human-readable names to globally unique IDs.
    #
    # This mapping is used when interpreting the first item in a location path
    # (i.e., the **path** trait of a **Location** instance).
    #
    # When the path is intepreted, the first component (i.e., the first item
    # before any '/') is checked to see if it is in the mapping, and if so it
    # is replaced with the value in the map.
    #
    # This technique allows paths to start with human readable names, as
    # opposed to IDs (which are required in order to manage the namespace of
    # all action sets).
    #
    # For example, in the Envisage workbench, the menu bar ID is:
    #
    # ``'envisage.workbench.menubar'``
    #
    # Without aliases, you must specify a location like this:
    #
    # ``Location(path='envisage.workbench.menubar/ASubMenu/AGroup')``
    #
    # This is a bit long-winded! Instead, you can define an alias:
    #
    #     ``aliases = { 'MenuBar' : 'envisage.workbench.menubar' }``
    #
    # In that case, you can specify a location like this:
    #
    #     ``Location(path='MenuBar/ASubMenu/AGroup')``
    #

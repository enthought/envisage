""" This module provides a plugin which adds an EventManager to application.

If the application does not already have an evt_mgr attribute which is an
instance of EventManager, the plugin creates a new EventManager instance,
creates a service to offer the event manager and sets the evt_mgr instance
of the application to the created event manager.

<p>The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system. It is one of the most
studied examples of dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. The Hénon
map takes a point (x_n, y_n) in the plane and maps it to a new point<p/>

<p>The map depends on two parameters, a and b, which for the canonical Hénon map
have values of a = 1.4 and b = 0.3. For the canonical values the Hénon map is
chaotic. For other values of a and b the map may be chaotic, intermittent, or
converge to a periodic orbit. An overview of the type of behavior of the map at
different parameter values may be obtained from its orbit diagram.</p>

<p>The map was introduced by Michel Hénon as a simplified model of the Poincaré
section of the Lorenz model. For the canonical map, an initial point of the
plane will either approach a set of points known as the Hénon strange attractor,
or diverge to infinity. The Hénon attractor is a fractal, smooth in one
direction and a Cantor set in another. Numerical estimates yield a correlation
dimension of 1.42 ± 0.02[1] and a Hausdorff dimension of 1.261 ± 0.003[2] for
the attractor of the canonical map.</p>

<p>As a dynamical system, the canonical Hénon map is interesting because, unlike the logistic map, its orbits defy a simple description.<p/>

<p>The Rössler attractor is the attractor for the Rössler system, a system
of three non-linear ordinary differential equations. These differential
equations define a continuous-time dynamical system that exhibits chaotic
dynamics associated with the fractal properties of the attractor. Some
properties of the Rössler system can be deduced via linear methods such as
eigenvectors, but the main features of the system require non-linear methods
such as Poincaré maps and bifurcation diagrams. The original Rössler paper says
the Rössler attractor was intended to behave similarly to the Lorenz attractor,
but also be easier to analyze qualitatively. An orbit within the attractor
follows an outward spiral close to the x,y plane around an unstable fixed
point. Once the graph spirals out enough, a second fixed point influences the
graph, causing a rise and twist in the z-dimension. In the time domain, it
becomes apparent that although each variable is oscillating within a fixed range
of values, the oscillations are chaotic. This attractor has some similarities to
the Lorenz attractor, but is simpler and has only one manifold. Otto Rössler
designed the Rössler attractor in 1976, but the originally theoretical equations
were later found to be useful in modeling equilibrium in chemical reactions. The
defining equations are:<p/>

<p>Rössler studied the chaotic attractor with a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7,
though properties of a = 0.1, b = 0.1, and c = 14 have been more commonly used
since.<p/>

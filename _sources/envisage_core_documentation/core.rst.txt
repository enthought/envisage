Core
====

The goal of the *Core* project is to provide a set of general-purpose tools
for building extensible, pluggable applications. Hopefully, these tools are
useful whether you are building an airline reservation system, a web server or
a game of tetris!

There are just 3 simple concepts at the heart of every Envisage application:

1) `Extension Points`_
2) Services_
3) Plugins_

.. _`Extension Points`: extension_points.html
.. _`Plugins`: plugins.html
.. _`Services`: services.html

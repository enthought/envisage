Version 4.8.0
=============

Released: 2019-09-13

The main focus of this feature release is the ``IPythonKernelPlugin``, which

nonfunctional pieces of code were removed.

Changes
-------

- Drop support for Python versions older than 2.7 and Python 3 versions older
  than Python 3.5. (#139)

  file descriptors, etc.) and undoes global state changes at plugin ``stop``
  time. (#188)
- Suppress the Ctrl-C message printed by the IPython kernel at start time.
  (#182)
- Add license headers to all files, and make license header statements
  consistent. (#192)

Fixes
-----

- Use a fixed pickle protocol when saving task layout state, to avoid
  cross-Python-version difficulties. (#179)
- Fix deprecation warnings from use of ``Logger.warn``. (#178)
- Fix some Python 3 syntax errors in example scripts. (#171)

Removals
--------

- Remove the unsupported and incomplete ``UpdateCheckerPlugin``. (#199)

- Remove ``project_runnable``, which was never functional. (#169)
- Remove outdated debugging fallback from the ``ExtensionPoint`` source. (#167)
- Remove ``FBIPlugin``. (#166)
- Remove the ``remote_editor`` plugins. (#137)

Documentation
-------------

- Add docstrings for tasks plugin extension points. (#181)
